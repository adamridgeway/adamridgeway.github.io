  <p> The Redirection of Context: Reference as Fuel for the Next

In The Ecstasy of Influence: A Plagiarism, Jonathan Lethem (2017, 59) introduces literature as a “…crucible in which familiar themes are continually recast.” Yet, this is not the only genre or medium to which Lethem applies this notion to. He attaches it to fields such as art, law, science and research. In fact, Lethem (2017, 61) posits that, “…appropriation, mimicry, quotation, allusion, and sublimated collaboration consist of a kind of sine qua non of the creative act, cutting across all forms and genres in the realm of cultural production.” Therefore, nothing is new and everything pushed forth into the world is the result of cryptomnesia, re-appropriation and reference without attribution. 
Often the first thing to do with a project is research. This immediately denies the work any titles of innovation, which is until the producer invents something ‘new.’ I say ‘new’ because according to Lethem, with whom I concur, invention is created out of past noise and chaos, as opposed to the inventors back pocket or the void unto which they will so likely claim. Why? Because if they invent from the void then they are a genius, yet if they invent through a pastiche of the past, then their potential heroism is tarnished. Originality is held in high regard within society, yet it seldom exists. 
Mr Keedy (2004) hints at a similar notion in his piece on Dumb Ideas. Keedy writes on the nuances and idiosyncrasies we apply to already formulated systems. In Dumb Ideas, Keedy (2004, 199) uses a custom typeface as the medium. Here, the characteristics of the letterforms are the nuances, yet the designer is not inventing a new language. The only way we can discern that it is a typeface is if it is directly similar to pre-established shapes that we already know as the English alphabet. 
However, is all of this necessarily bad? I’ve made it sound like plagiarism is our worst inescapable enemy but my intention is to show how deeply it proliferates and infiltrates, yet benefits almost every creative decision we make. Lethem (2017, 61) outright advocates plagiarism using individuals like William Shakespeare and Bob Dylan suggesting they would not have achieved what they did without plagiarism. So, if it’s not all bad and we should be grateful for plagiarism, can we expect to see the modern day Shakespeare or Dylan come out of the Internet using similar means? Collaging their way through a more recent and less traversed medium. Is there enough history in the Internet to start doing so? Is J.R Carpenter’s (2015) article on The Handcrafted Web or Brandon Invergo’s (2013) Anti-Web Design Manifesto an early documentation of an online pastiche? What these two pieces represent are interpretations of the early Internet that seem unfamiliar. Although they might not be the next Dylan, the idea is similar and their efforts indicate that there is enough history to pull from. That said, Lethem promotes a multi-disciplinary, cross-pollination, melting pot of industries, fields and professions when it comes to plagiarism. It is more about the how the stew tastes, rather than its ingredients. 
So how do we stimulate change now? What can we as designers do to help fuel ideas? After all, the ideas in which we generate are only as good as their influence on others. Lethem (2017, 63) states: 

Today, when we can eat Tex-Mex with chopsticks while listening to reggae and watching a YouTube rebroadcast of the Berlin Wall’s fall — i.e., when damn near everything presents itself as familiar — it’s not a surprise that some of today’s most ambitious art is going about trying to make the familiar strange.

Therefore, in order to enact change, we must embrace Martin Heidegger’s (Lethem 2017, 62) ideologies in resituating ourselves in relation to the ‘thing.’ In this case, the ‘thing’ is the Internet. Furthermore, what if we extended this notion of making the familiar strange beyond art and introduced it into commerce. What if an e-commerce website were to shun orthodoxies and present themselves to the consumer in a strange way?
Take ‘Like Clothing’ for example. Like is Lucinda Trask’s clothing label. It has a ready-to-wear line along with non-seasonal collections that ‘mix high-concept and reimagined, everyday basics’ (Like Clothing 2017). However, Like’s offering however is not of particular importance here, the focus is on their website and look book. Their website presents familiar content in a ‘strange’ way. It is a single scroll, looping, typographically heavy, audio fueled website with a constant scroll like film credits. There is no ‘shop now’ button and the main emphasis of the website is around their look book. That said, the look book is of the most importance in this analysis as their ‘look book’ is actually a ‘look film.’ Written and directed by Harry Gassel, the film follows a man and a woman in impromptu dialogue wearing Like Clothing garments. The film is immersive enough in and of itself, whilst also subversively depicting head-to-toe, portraits and garment details to of course flaunt the product. 
Gassel and Trask use a number of industries to draw inspiration from such as film, literature and photography in order to resituate the ‘thing’ for us as consumers. For once, we are not being bombarded with discount coupons, limited offers and free shipping, and it’s actually quite alluring. We are in fact enveloped in a narrative and taken on an experiential journey that forever changes our relationship to said product. 
Similarly, yet using a different medium, Spike Jonze and Opening Ceremony collaborated on a play together called “Changers”. The play was a continuous forty-minute narrative with no dialogue. Two characters use dance and movement to communicate the script. The tale is of a relationship and the evolution of that relationship. The two characters showcase garments from Opening Ceremony’s Fall collection (scheduled to drop the following day) throughout the piece, promoting their commercial offering through an artistic display. Additionally, American Express sponsored the event and the proceeds from those visiting the life play were donated to the Greater Houston Community Foundation’s Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund.  Again, through narrative, the consumer is involved in a far more poetic, experiential relationship with the product. 
Therefore, through a collage of industries and techniques, inspiration and innovation, Like Clothing and “Changers” has successfully shifted the ‘thing’ out of familiar context and given it new life. The process of which expresses the importance of reference and collaboration ‘cutting across all forms and genres in the realm of cultural production’ (Lethem 2017, 61). It provides a reference point for designers who want to enact or stimulate change in order to help fuel ideas. If Gassel or Jonze are just leaves on a windy day (Lethem 2017, 68) then they too have served their purpose in providing others with inspiration for their own inventions.
